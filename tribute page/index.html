        <h2>Father of Physics</h2>
        <p>
          <b> SIR ISAAC NEWTON</b> , born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England, is renowned as one
          of the most influential scientists in history. He laid the groundwork for classical mechanics and made
          significant contributions to mathematics and optics.

          Newton's seminal work, "Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica," published in 1687, introduced his laws
          of motion and the law of universal gravitation. These laws provided a comprehensive framework for
          understanding the motion of celestial bodies and objects on Earth, unifying terrestrial and celestial
          mechanics.

          In mathematics, Newton developed calculus independently around the same time as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. His
          work in optics included experiments with prisms and the discovery that white light is composed of a spectrum
          of colors.

          Newton served as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and was knighted in
          1705. His profound impact on science and mathematics has earned him the title "Father of Physics" and
          solidified his legacy as a key figure in the Scientific Revolution. Newton passed away on March 31, 1727, in
          London.
